excerpt: BRPF3 is a crucial scaffold protein in gene transcription regulation, forming a complex with HBO1 histone acetyltransferase. Our study reveals that BRPF3 bromodomain interacts with mono- and di-acetylated histone peptides (H4K5ac and H4K5acK12ac). Pull-down assays with full-length histones confirm this interaction. Molecular dynamics simulations illustrate the binding mechanism and stability of the bromodomain-histone peptide complexes. These findings shed light on how BRPF3 directs HBO1 complex recruitment to chromatin for transcriptional regulation.

Bromodomains are evolutionarily conserved reader modules that recognize acetylated lysine residues on the histone tails to facilitate gene transcription. The bromodomain and PHD finger containing protein 3 (BRPF3) is a scaffolding protein that forms a tetrameric complex with HBO1 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and two other subunits, which is known to regulate the HAT activity and substrate specificity. However, its molecular mechanism, histone ligands, and biological functions remain unknown. Herein, we identify mono- (H4K5ac) and di- (H4K5acK12ac) acetylated histone peptides as novel interacting partners of the BRPF3 bromodomain. Consistent with this, pull-down assays on purified histones from human cells confirm the interaction of BRPF3 bromodomain with acetylated histone H4. Further, MD simulation studies highlight the binding mode of acetyllysine (Kac) and the stability of bromodomain-histone peptide complexes. Collectively, our findings provide a key insight into how histone targets of the BRPF3 bromodomain direct the recruitment of HBO1 complex to chromatin for downstream transcriptional regulation.
